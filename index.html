  <h1>machine learning with polynomials.</h1>
</div>
<p>
    Effective Quadratures is an open-source Python-based library that supports a wide range of utilities in uncertainty quantification, dimension reduction, sensitivity analysis and optimisation—all using polynomials. The project was initially born out of a need to replicate the results of various works within the field of polynomial chaos. It has subsequently morphed into a dedicated effort to use polynomials for a range of objectives under the broad umbrella of supervised machine learning.
